# Asynchronous Programming Concepts

## About

Asynchronous programming is at the heart of JavaScript and code execution in the browser. It is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially long running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs.

This repository was thus created as a study to have a deeper more full comprehension of the underlying concepts of asynchronous programming.

### Promises

The `Promise` object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

Depending on the outcome of the asynchronous operation, promises can be in three states:

1. Pending: set initially, while the asynchronous operation is in progress
2. Fulfilled: the asynchronous operation has finished successfully
3. Rejected: the operation has failed

- When a promise enters either *fulfilled* or *rejected* states, it is said to be *settled*

How to build a promise?

- Promises are created using the constructor pattern.
- When called via `new` operator, the `Promise` constructor returns a promise object
- The constructor takes one function (the `executor` function)
- The `executor` function accepts two parameters: `resolveFunction` or `rejectFunction`
- `resolveFunction` and `rejectFunction` are callback functions, and can be given whatever names you want, they accept a single parameter of any type
- `resolveFunction(value) // call on resolve` : the `value` parameter can also be another promise object
- `rejectFunction(reason) // call on rejected` : has semantics close to the `throw` statement, so `reason` is typically an error instance.
- Any errors thrown in the `executor` will cause the promise to be rejected, and the return value will be neglected
