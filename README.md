## About

Asynchronous programming is at the heart of JavaScript and code execution in the browser. It is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially long running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs.

This repository was thus created as a study to have a deeper more full comprehension of the underlying concepts of asynchronous programming.
