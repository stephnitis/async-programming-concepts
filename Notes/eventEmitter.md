# Event Emitter

The EventEmitter is a module that facilitates communication/interaction between objects in Node. EventEmitter is at the core of Node asynchronous event-driven architecture.

An event emitter is a pattern that listens to a named event, fires a callback, then emits that event with a value.

An emitter object basically has two main features:

1. Emitting name events
2. Registering and unregistering listener functions
